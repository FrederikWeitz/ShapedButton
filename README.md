# ShapedButton
These are three "studies" in graphics and animation.

1. CloverButton provides a class with a shape and button-functionality.
The hover- and pressed-Colours can be set; the way, the button is moving, can be altered by setting conditions.
First of all I've been interested in creating a button with no rectangular shape; 
then, how to get this shape moving under certain conditions.
It is a very primitive example with pure basics on animating and displaying more "artistic" GUIs.

ShapeTest delivers an example on how to use the class CloverButton.

2. Main-Package has two different and separate Examples:
ControllList focusses on changing the display to get access to some Control-Elements. It is an Example for a ListView, too.
ScrollImage presents three graphic Elements, two simply moving, one that can be controlled by three sliders.
